# Scratch/BYOB Obfuscator

This is a fun project for obfuscating Scratch/BYOB projects using
[scratchlib](https://github.com/JangoBrick/scratchlib).

## Note on Cloning

Since this is using scratchlib as a submodule, cloning needs to be done
recursively. The submodule may also not be edited directly.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/JangoBrick/scratch-obfuscator.git
```
